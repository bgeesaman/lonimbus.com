title: MaaS Part 1 - Netboot Macs and PXEBooting PCs from Linux
layout: post
summary: How to netboot Macs and pxeboot PC servers to the latest Centos 7.x OS with only a Linux server providing support? 

---

When building a "Metal as a Service" (MAAS) layer, the idea is to make it very easy to go from "box to rack to ready" for a large number of servers.  To make this easier and to reduce complexity at this layer, most organizations purchase one or more sets of similar servers from a single manufacturer.  Depending on the level of service, they may have the manufacturer/vendor prepare the systems a certain way before they show up at the door.  A technician can just unbox them, inventory the asset, slide them into the rack, cable it up, and be done with their part.

The goal is that the provisioning system picks up from the power-on event from that point on.  It gets a base operating system followed by some configuration management to put it into a production state.  When that system is no longer being used in that production state, it goes through a similar re-provisioning process to become useful again for another application.

Naturally, this can get out of hand without proper tooling once you go past, say, 10 servers.  I've been doing a fair bit of reading about this, and [Digital Rebar](http://rebar.digital) looks like the best of breed for the power and customization aspects.  It's the latest from the folks that developed Crowbar.

So why am I not going to use Digital Rebar?

Well, two reasons.  I know that learning comes best from experiencing the pain firsthand.  So instead of just dropping in a very impressive toolset that does 500 things more than I need, I wanted to get familiar with the handful of things I do need in a focused way.  I could spend a few days installing and configuring Digital Rebar and learning the way it solves the problem while relearning all that forgotten PXEBoot knowledge from 10 years ago, or I could choose to do one thing at a time and truly understand the simplest use case.

Secondly, I have a mix of systems, and I don't believe my use case is baked into Digital Rebar.  Namely, Mac Netboot support alongside PC PXEboot support.  Until I got it working, I didn't even know if it was possible.  As far as I can google, it's not been documented anywhere public.  Maybe these posts will spark a discussion of working that support into a tool like Digital Rebar, but I'm not sure of the popularity of it.  I mean, most folks want to Netboot OSX on a Mac or at least dual boot with Linux, not just Linux alone.

## The Problem

So, how do I get Macs and PC servers to go from bare metal to a common base Centos 7.x latest state with a known IP configuration, hostname, and SSH access booting just Linux?

1. [Create a deploy host.](#deploy-host)
2. [Install and configure a DHCP server, a TFTP server, and a Webserver](#supporting-services)
3. [Custom configuration](#custom-configuration)
4. [Walking Through the Process](#walking-through-the-process)

### Deploy Host ###

I am using a low-power Celeron system as my base Centos 7.x system from which to develop, test, and provide netboot and pxeboot support.  I had downloaded the minimal ISO from [here](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1511.iso), ran dd to [write it directly to a USB](http://osxdaily.com/2015/06/05/copy-iso-to-usb-drive-mac-os-x-command/), and did a manual installation of the base packages.

Finally, I gave it a static IP of ```172.22.10.2/24``` on the management network, added a DNS entry for the hostname called ```deploy``` on my pfsense system (```172.22.10.1```), and generated a [new SSH keypair](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).

Now, from my workstation, I can SSH into the ```deploy``` system on the management network that my servers have their primary NIC attached, build, and run the [containers](https://github.com/bgeesaman/netpxemirror).

### Supporting Services ###

I'll admit I spent over a week getting Netboot to work from a Linux DHCP server trying several angles.  I tried very hard to use ipxe in several ways, but never got very far. Oddly enough, I spent only 2 hrs adding PXEBoot support to that same DHCP/TFTP setup for the PCs.

I owe all I learned about this process from:

Thank you to those above who paved the way.  I will take a smidge of credit for tying this all together in terms of grub2 booting over the network and figuring out the EFI stuff, but the heavy lifting and the DHCP Netboot trickery they did was pretty impressive.

##### Basic PXE/NetBoot Process #####

My hope is that understanding the boot process along with reading the comments in the handful of configuration files in the Docker containers will make things clear for anyone else attempting this.

Here's the basic, high level process of PXE/Netbooting.

1. System is booted from a NIC that supports PXEbooting.  This typically means changing the boot order to have the NIC first, hitting a key to network boot just this time, or configuring a BMC or ILOM card to boot the system from the network.
2. The system acquires an IP address via DHCP/Bootp.  A properly configured DHCP server will respond with an IP, subnet, gateway, and file to boot from.
3. Optionally, the system also asks for a pointer to a file to boot from over the network.
4. If supplied by the DHCP server, the system uses the ```next-server``` and ```filename``` results to TFTP download/run that bootable file.
  ![grub efi tftp](/assets/images/grub-efi-tftp.png){:class="img-responsive"}
5. From there, the bootable file controls the remainder of the boot process (install an OS, run an OS from memory, etc).  Often, this means hosting via a web server or FTP server the configuration for installation and even a repository of all the installation packages for the OS.

  ![final](/assets/images/final-kickstart.png){:class="img-responsive"}

##### Back to Configuring all this stuff #####

I originally got this working with the version of isc-dhcp-server, tftpd, and httpd from the Centos7.x repos installed natively on ```deploy```, but all the working and non-working config files, log files, and such were cluttering things up.  It was very difficult to iterate knowing what files were being used or not.

So, of course, I decided to address that by [dockerizing those services](https://github.com/bgeesaman/netpxemirror), wiping the deploy system, and redeploying the same services from pure docker containers.  By recreating all my work and encapsulating it properly into Docker containers, I have a way to share my work that folks may be able to understand.

This also means my ```deploy``` system really only needs to run Docker and the knowledge to build and run the containers from scratch can come from a git repo.

On the ```deploy``` system, it's installation was pretty straightforward.  I followed the [Centos 7.x guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/centos/) for getting Docker up and running at boot.  I use an account named ```admin``` with sudo privileges on my ```deploy``` host, so I added ```admin``` to the ```docker``` group to avoid having to type ```sudo``` on every docker command.

##### What needs to be dockerized: #####

* DHCP - isc-dhcp-server - Provide IPs and pointers to TFTP boot files
* TFTP - tftpd-hpa - Provide bootable grub2 images and grub.cfg files
* Web - apache2 - Provide Kickstart configuration files and a local Centos 7.x mirror
* Rsync - createrepo and rsync - Run on cron to keep the mirror updated each night

Right away, we know that this can get messy really quickly.  Custom DHCP configs, TFTP roots, Web roots and configurations, and of course, the 28GB of stuff in the Centos 7.x Repo in that web root.  Thankfully, the process of Dockerizing forces things to be explicitly handled properly.

Here is that repository with those services broken up into three separate containers: [https://github.com/bgeesaman/netpxemirror](https://github.com/bgeesaman/netpxemirror)

On my ```deploy``` system, after installing Docker, I ran:

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/bgeesaman/netpxemirror.git
Cloning into 'netpxemirror'...
remote: Counting objects: 50, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (34/34), done.
remote: Total 50 (delta 11), reused 47 (delta 11), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (50/50), done.
$ cd netpxemirror
### Configure the services to your environment ###
$ ./build.sh
$ ./run.sh
```
This built and ran ```netpxeboot```, ```centos7mirror```, and ```mirrorsync```.  

## WARNING 
Running the ```mirrorsync``` container for the first time will immediately begin rsyncing 28GB of data into ```/var/www/html/repos```!  I did this so that I could restore the state of a working ```deploy``` system from scratch assuming there was no local repo already.  Edit the ```mirrorsync/files/start.sh``` to prevent this behavior before running ```build.sh```.

Assuming the configuration is correct, a ```docker ps``` shows:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
9bcdd7f44d38        netpxeboot          "/root/start.sh"       14 hours ago        Up 14 hours                              netpxeboot
6a1c28fdfc7a        mirrorsync          "/root/start.sh"       15 hours ago        Up 15 hours                              mirrorsync
eebd43890189        centos7mirror       "apache2-foreground"   23 hours ago        Up 23 hours         0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   centos7mirror
```

Keen observers will notice that TCP port 80 is forwarded to the ```centos7mirror``` container running apache2, but UDP/67 and UDP/69 are not for ```netpxeboot```.  That's because the ```netpxeboot``` container is started with ```--net=host``` in the ```docker run``` command so that it can bind to the host's network stack and see broadcasts from the systems asking for IP addresses.

### Containers at a Glance###

##### centos7mirror #####
Based on the [php:5.6-apache](https://github.com/docker-library/php/blob/f016f5dc420e7d360f7381eb014ac6697e247e11/5.6/apache/Dockerfile) container, I add a custom ```docker-php.conf``` to apache and enable ```mod_rewrite```.  This makes this a PHP 5.6 webserver with the ability to serve up dynamic content based on the request data and to make the URLs cleaner.

##### mirrorsync #####
Based on [phusion/baseimage](https://hub.docker.com/r/phusion/baseimage), this Ubuntu based system provides a simple cron based functionality to keep the Yum repository in sync with the Centos 7.x mirror of my choice.

##### netpxeboot #####
Also based on [phusion/baseimage](https://hub.docker.com/r/phusion/baseimage), this Ubuntu based system provides the isc-dhcp-server, tftpd-hpa server, and the configuration files for grub booting over TFTP.  A PHP script for serving custom kickstart files out of the webroot in ```centos7mirror``` based on mac address is also here.

### Custom Configuration ###
Now, there's probably a 100% chance that the containers didn't work for you if you simply git cloned them and tried building them.  So, I'll point you to each of the places that you'll want to edit for your needs.  Namely, the IP addresses, paths, and URLs for things.  I'll start with the local mirror and mirror syncing process.

##### centos7mirror #####
Realistically, there is very little to configure here with the exception of the web root and the name of the file you want associated with serving kickstart configurations.  I chose ```/var/www/html``` since it's the default for the web root.  Also, the ```ks.cfg``` mod_rewrite rule actually calls the ```/var/www/html/ks.php``` file for knowing what kickstart to serve up.  ```ks.php``` is put into place by ```netpxeboot``` on its first run.

##### mirrorsync #####
If you edited the web root path, you'll need to search/replace it in all the files in the ```files``` directory.  Mostly, though, you'll want to edit the ```cron.sh``` file to pull from another repo and ```crontab``` to adjust the schedule of when the sync happens.

```
11 1 * * * root /root/cron.sh >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
```
Means it runs on the eleventh minute of the first hour of every day.  I tend to use slighty "off" times to avoid contention with other folks who run their jobs on the hour exactly.

##### netpxeboot #####
The files ```ADD```ed  in the Dockerfile into this container are the primary points of configuration, but I'll warn you that making one incorrect change here can easily break things.

```ks.php``` serves up kickstart files in ```/var/www/html/cfg/ma:ca:dd:re:ss.cfg``` based on the mac address sent in the header as configured from the ```grub.cfg``` option called ```inst.ks.sendmac```

```tftpd-hpa``` specifies mostly the base path of the TFTP files.  In my case, ```/nbi```

```dhcpd.conf``` is where the PXE/Netbooting magic happens.  Reserved IPs, lease times and ranges, paths, and more go here.  If you don't have PCs, remove the ```pc``` class block.  If you don't have Macs, remove the entire ```netboot``` class block.

### Walking Through the Process ###

##### Step 1: #####

Boot the system from the network.  My Dells and SuperMicros use ```f12``` and the Macs have you hold ```n``` right at and slightly after the boot chime.  Helps to have a keyboard and mouse on these systems as you iterate.

##### Step 2: #####

On the ```deploy``` system, you can run: ```tcpdump -ni eth0 not port 22``` to watch the process unfold.  This is my primary method of debugging along with watching the screen as it boots.  You'll see the system request an address via DHCP.  If your DHCP server is configured and listening correctly, you'll see it respond with a DHCP reply.  On your PC system, you should see something indicating it got an IP.  Macs just show the blinking globe by default unless you enable verbose booting.

##### Step 3: #####

Very shortly after the DHCP lease is acquired, you'll see a TFTP RRQ for the ```boot/grub/i386-pc/core.0``` or ```mactel64.efi``` binary.  Both of them should initialize grub on the system to a point that it can look for its proper ```grub.cfg``` file on that same TFTP server.  In that tcpdump output, you'll see the file grabs over UDP/69 and the paths/names requested.  You can narrow things down to only what's being pulled via TFTP by running ```tcpdump -ni eth0 port 69``` if you are having pathing or file name issues.

##### Step 4: #####
